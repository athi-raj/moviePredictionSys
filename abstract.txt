ABSTRACT

The Movie Success Prediction System is a full-stack web application designed to forecast the commercial performance of films prior to their release using machine learning techniques. In an industry driven by high financial stakes and audience expectations, this system provides a data-informed approach to support decision-making for producers, distributors, and marketers.
The application leverages a curated dataset containing features such as director reputation, cast popularity, genre classification, production budget, and anticipated audience ratings. After comprehensive preprocessing including feature engineering, encoding, and normalization a Random Forest Classifier was trained to classify movies as either likely "success" or "failure."
The model demonstrated high performance based on standard evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, and recall), confirming the significance of structured data in predicting box-office outcomes. Integrated into a user-friendly interface, the system offers real-time prediction capabilities, making it both practical and scalable.
This project illustrates the powerful role of machine learning and full-stack development in transforming creative industries through intelligent forecasting and resource optimization.
