## 📄 About the Project
The Movie Success Prediction System is a data-driven web application designed to estimate the likelihood of a movie becoming a box-office success prior to its release. By employing historical data and key film attributes, the system provides insightful predictions that can assist producers, marketers, and investors in strategic decision-making.

The prediction model is built using a Random Forest Classifier, trained on a curated dataset with features engineered to reflect critical success factors in the film industry. Key predictive variables include:

- Director's track record of past successes

- Popularity scores of lead actors

- Genre distribution and appeal

- Allocated production budget

- Anticipated audience ratings

To ensure optimal model performance, the data underwent rigorous preprocessing, including categorical encoding, normalization, and feature extraction. The result is a robust full-stack application that seamlessly combines machine learning with a modern user interface to deliver accurate and actionable outcomes.
